/**
Non-Linear
Hierarchial
Can have only one parent 
Can have multiple children 
Top most level node is called "root"
No cycles

/** 
 Why do we need trees ?? - BEcause we cannot store everything is arrays , we need some other DS to store data in parent child fashion
 Example - File system

/** 
 Traversal Types : - 
 1. Pre-order traversal
 2. In-order traversal
 3. Post order traversal 
 4. Level-order traversal
 */

1. Pre-order traversal => root -> left -> right
2. In-order traversal => left -> root -> right
3. Post-order traversal => left -> right -> root
